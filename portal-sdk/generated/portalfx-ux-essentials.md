### Essentials

Essentials are a high-level snapshot of a resource. The Essentials pane contains the most important resource properties, along with links to other locations in the portal. The content in the Essentials pane is divided into two columns: the left column shows 5 properties similar to the Browse view, while the right column shows 5 properties specific to the resource. Extensions decide what properties to show in the right column, and whether they're static or dynamic.

Properties **can** contain links, and can open blades containing related resources (for example, resource group, subscription, hosting plan, etc). The links can also point to external sites. Properties **can't** open blades that collect information.

Everything that appears in the Essentials pane should also be accessible in <strong>Settings</strong>.
