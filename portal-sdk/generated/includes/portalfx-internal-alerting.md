##### Alerting (Microsoft Internal Only)

The Portal team manages alerts for when your extension fails to load.  The Extension Load Failure alert will create an ICM incident which we will route to your team based on the [spreadsheet here](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/azureteams/aapt/azureux/RM/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bC322B2D3-5F69-4AD4-BA26-AF93D3AE6FAA%7d&file=Partner%20Incident%20Routing.xlsx&action=default).  

If you are using MDS logging, you can create additional alerts for your extension through the [Geneva Monitoring system](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/?page=documents&section=f787c5ad-c22e-48aa-898a-1a042632f9d1&id=8a22767c-90e3-4fe6-9ea5-e421422d0e2c).  Please ensure that any alerts created are initially routed to your team (not the Portal team).

If you are using AppInsights, then please contact the [AppInsights team](mailto:VSAIDiscussion@microsoft.com).
