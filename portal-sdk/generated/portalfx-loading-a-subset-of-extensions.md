## Loading a Subset of Extensions
There are some instances during test where you may want to only load your extension or a subset of extensions within the portal. You can do this using the feature.DisableExtensions feature flag. 

Usage: 

```
?feature.DisableExtensions=true&HubsExtension=true&Microsoft_Azure_Support=true&MyOtherExtension=true
```

- This will make every extension disabled by default.
- This will enable hubs (which almost everyone needs).
- This will enable the particular extension you want to test. 
- You can add multiple like the HubsExtension=true and MyOtherExtension=true if you want to test other extensions.
