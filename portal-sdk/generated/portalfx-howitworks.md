## How the portal works

The [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) provides a consistent user interface that enables integration with various first and third party Microsoft Azure services. The portal is a [single page application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) which can dynamically load a collection of extensions.  Extensions are loaded via an IFRAME that provides a layer of isolation.  The IFRAMEs loaded by the portal do not project any visuals - they are entirely hidden.  Instead, the scripts loaded by these IFRAME interact with the API provided by the Azure Portal SDK.  This allows the portal to provide a consistent, safe, and predictable experience for users.

## How extensions work

Extensions are simply web applications written using the [Azure Portal SDK](../generated/downloads.md).  The web application will provide content loaded by the portal in an isolated context.

- Typically an extension is an [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) project, which is modified to include content specific to the portal.
- The client APIs use [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) to provide a productive experience for building JavaScript.
- TypeScript is built using the [Asynchronous Module Loader (AMD)](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) module system via [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).
- The core programming model follows the [Model View ViewModel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) pattern. Most [UI elements](/documentation/articles/portalfx-ui-concepts) in the portal are backed by dynamic view models, which provide a 'live tile' style of UX.
- View models make heavy use of [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) for binding data to the client.
- Building custom UI is enabled using standard web technologies like [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
- Extensions are deployed to an endpoint owned by the service administrator.  Extension authors are responsible for hosting their own extensions.

**NOTE:** Learn more about [deployment](/documentation/articles/portalfx-deployment).

When a user visits the Azure portal, extensions will be loaded based on the users subscription. Extensions can be loaded asynchronously, and even deactivated when it's not currently in use.

### What&#39;s different?

The new Azure portal at [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com) is significantly different from a developer perspective from the portal at [http://manage.windowsazure.com](http://manage.windowsazure.com). Based on feedback from developers who extended the management portal, we set out to solve a few challenges.

**NOTE:** The management portal at [http://manage.windowsazure.com](http://manage.windowsazure.com) can still be used for customers who require services not yet available on [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com).

- Instead of a single frame, extensions run in their own IFRAME. This provides a certain level of process isolation, allowing for greater reliability, and data protection.
- Instead of a single code repository, extensions are now developed in a separate repository from the shell.
- Extension authors do not need to enlist the Azure portal source code repository to add new experiences.
- Extension authors are free to deploy their service as frequently or infrequently as desired.
- The new portal only loads the experiences required for the current user. Extensions can be removed from the portal at runtime if they are not being used, and dynamically re-loaded.
