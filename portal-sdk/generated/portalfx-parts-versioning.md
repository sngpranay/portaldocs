### Versioning

When users customize or pin a part the following state is stored and used the next time the part is loaded from a customized context.

1. Basic part metadata (e.g. part name, extension name, etc)
1. Part inputs (e.g. resource id)
1. Part settings (e.g. time range for a chart).

Over time, extension developers will find the need to modify the schema of a  part's inputs and/or settings to support new functionality.  Ibiza will always call your latest code, but it may call it with older versions of inputs and settings that were stored when an earlier version of your code was active.  

Your part may also be called with older inputs by code running in other extensions that may have taken a dependency on an earlier version of your part.  This is what happens when another extension uses a .pde file along with a `<PartReference/>`. 

To handle this you need to support backwards compatibility in your code.

### Walkthrough

For part inputs we've added the **CanUseOldInputVersion** attribute that you should set to true to indicate that your part can handle older versions of inputs.  We recommend you use that in conjunction with a new part property/input called 'version'.  

Inline parts can define the current version as a constant.  In this case, this is the first explicit version.  We recommend using 2 the first time you do this.

```xml
<Part Name="RobotPart"
      ViewModel="{ViewModel Name=RobotPartViewModel, Module=./Browse/ViewModels/RobotPartViewModel}"
      CanUseOldInputVersions="true"
      PartKind="Button"
      AssetType="Robot"
      AssetIdProperty="name">
    <Part.Properties>
        <Property Name="version"
                  Source="{Constant 2}" />
        <Property Name="name"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=id}" />
    </Part.Properties>
</Part>
```

Globally defined parts can't specify constant bindings, but the flow is mostly the same.

```xml
<CustomPart Name="RobotSummary2"
            Export="true"
            ViewModel="RobotSummaryViewModel"
            CanUseOldInputVersions="true"
            Template="{Html Source='Templates\\Robot.html'}"
            InitialSize="FullWidthFitHeight">
    <CustomPart.Properties>
        <Property Name="name"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=name}" />
        <Property Name="version"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=version}" /> <!-- currently 2 -->
    </CustomPart.Properties>
</CustomPart>
```

The meat of the solution is in your part view model code.  The example below shows how to handle explicitly versioned inputs as well as the version of your parts that existed in the wild before you added explicit versioning support.

```javascript
public onInputsSet(inputs: Def.InputsContract, settings: Def.SettingsContract): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        var name: string;
        if (inputs.version === "2") {  // this block explicitly handles version 2, which is the latest
            name = inputs.name;
        } else if (inputs.version === "1") { // this block explicitly handles version 1, which is now old, but was an explicit version
            var oldInputs: any = inputs;
            name = oldInputs.oldName;
        } else if (MsPortalFx.Util.isNullOrUndefined(inputs.version)) { // this block handles any version of the inputs
            var oldestInputs: any = inputs;                             //  that existed before the version property was added
            name = oldestInputs.oldestName;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Unexpected version.  This should not happen, but there is one edge case where you temporarily deploy a new version, say version 3, and then roll back your code to version 2.  Any tiles pinned before you roll back will hit this block.");
        }
        return this._view.fetch(name);
    }
```

You can use the same exact technique for part settings.

```javascript
public onInputsSet(inputs: Def.InputsContract, settings: Def.SettingsContract): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        var someSetting: string;
        if (settings.version === "2") {  // this block explicitly handles version 2, which is the latest
            someSetting = settings.someSetting;
        } else if (settings.version === "1") { // this block explicitly handles version 1, which is now old, but was an explicit version
            var oldSettings: any = settings;
            someSetting = oldSettings.oldSetting;
        } else if (MsPortalFx.Util.isNullOrUndefined(settings.version)) { // this block handles any version of the settings
            var oldestSettings: any = string;                             //  that existed before the version property was added
            someSetting = oldestSettings.oldestSetting;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Unexpected version.  This should not happen, but there is one edge case where you temporarily deploy a new version, say version 3, and then roll back your code to version 2.  Any tiles pinned before you roll back will hit this block.");
        }
        return this._view.fetch(name);
    }
```
