## Forms  ##

The Portal SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input through the use of Forms. Forms offer the ability to take advantage of features such as consistent form layout styles, form integrated UI widgets, user input validation, and data change tracking.

### Layout ###

Use form sections to group controls, and even other sections, into structure layouts based on rows and columns. When using form sections to create your form, you reap the benefit of our predefined forms styles, maintained consistency with proven user usability tests, all while retaining the flexibility to layout your forms in any manner you.

### Content ###

Form-integrated controls are the UI widgets that come prebaked with form compatibility. These controls should be used in a vast majority of forms scenarios. Form-integrated controls integrate with a form to automatically enable good form patterns, built in validation, and auto-tracking of changes.


Form-integrated controls:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Button </td>
  <td>Content Cell</td>
</tr>
