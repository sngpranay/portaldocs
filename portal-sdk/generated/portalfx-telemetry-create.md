# <a name="GetCreateFlows"></a>GetCreateFlows(startDate: datetime, endDate: datetime)

<a name="a-name-getcreateflows-a-getcreateflows-startdate-datetime-enddate-datetime-summary"></a>
## Summary
This function returns the list of Portal Azure service deployment lifecycles, also known as 'create flows', for a given time range.
* Each create flow represents the lifecycle of a create with the beginning being marked by the moment the create blade is opened and ending the moment that the create has been concluded and logged by the Portal.
* Data for each create is curated and joined between Portal data logs and available ARM deployment data logs.

<a name="a-name-getcreateflows-a-getcreateflows-startdate-datetime-enddate-datetime-common-use-cases"></a>
## Common Use Cases
* Identifying the number of creates completed for a given Extension or for a particular Azure marketplace gallery package.
* Calculating the percentage of successful creates initiated by an Extension's create blade.
* Debugging failed deployments by retrieving error message information logged for failed creates.
* Calculating the number of creates that were abandoned by the user before being initiated and completed.
* Identifying creates initiated by a given user id.
* Calculating the average create duration by data center.
