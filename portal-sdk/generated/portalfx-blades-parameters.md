### Blade Parameters

Blades must explicitly declare which parameters they are required to receive.  Think of this as a function signature. There are multiple types of parameters, each of which can serve a special purpose.

<a name="blade-parameters-key-parameters"></a>
#### Key Parameters

Key parameters define properties which act as the primary key for the blade. A common example may be "Website Id: 42" for a given blade. Often, a blade will have a single input which defines this identifier. Key properties are used as a key in the shell to save user settings like the layout of the blade, part sizes, part state, etc.

```xml
<Blade>
  ...
  <Blade.Parameters>

    <!--
      Typically a blade will have a key property (or set of key properties)
      that indicate uniqueness of the data within the blade.
     -->
    <Parameter Name="WebsiteId" Type="Key" />

  </Blade.Parameters>
</Blade>
```

<a name="blade-parameters-neweditscope-parameters"></a>
#### NewEditScope Parameters

For parts which provide form editing capabilities, they often need to request an editScopeId. Previously, developers were required to provide a name for this input, and go through some trials to access the Id. It is now provided as a simple input which can be accessed view the `editScopeId` BladeParameter.

```xml
<Blade>
  ...
  <Blade.Parameters>
    <!--
      EditScopes are a special kind of input. They are generated from the shell,
      and are not passed via a blade binding.
    -->
    <Parameter Type="NewEditScope" />
  </Blade.Parameters>
</Blade>
```

<a name="blade-parameters-output-parameters"></a>
#### Output Parameters

Output parameters provide the ability to receive an input from a child blade. Functionally little has changed with output bindings, but now they are a special defined type of input:

```xml
<Blade>
  ...
  <Blade.Parameters>
    <!--
      Output parameters are not set at invocation time, and cannot be keys or edit scopes.
    -->
    <Parameter Name="queryMetricId" Type="Output" />
  </Blade.Parameters>
</Blade>
```

<a name="blade-parameters-supplemental-parameters"></a>
#### Supplemental Parameters

Supplemental parameters provide no special function, and are not a key, but are used as additional data required by the part.

```xml
<Blade>
  ...
  <Blade.Parameters>

    <!--
      Supplemental inputs provide non-key parameters from launching blade. These may
      come from a different part on the launching blade.
    -->
    <Parameter Name="checkBoxValue" Type="Supplemental" />

  </Blade.Parameters>
</Blade>
```
