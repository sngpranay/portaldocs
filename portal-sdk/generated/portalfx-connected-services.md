# Hubs Overview
Hubs are horizontal, cross-cutting services positioned in the vertical bar on
the left side of the window to enable quick access to navigation and
aggregated content.

  * **Notifications** aggregates system-wide messages, warnings, and errors
  * **Browse** provides quick access to apps and services
  * **Journeys** enables easy task-switching
  * **Billing** surfaces subscription usage and costs
  * **New** facilitates creating new resources in the Gallery

The portal uses a provider model for all connected services (e.g.
authentication, notifications). Each instance of the portal can be configured
to be disconnected for local (aka onebox) development or connected to Azure
cloud services for end-to-end testing. In time, the portal will also support
on-premises and even hybrid connectivity. By default, the portal runs in a
disconnected mode to simplify local development. To configure cloud
connectivity, refer to the respective sections for each connected service.
