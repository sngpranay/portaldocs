# NuGet packages for Extension Dependencies

NuGet has been selected to provided a simple way to both deliver and update portal framework assemblies, tools, test framework and extension PDE files. All extensions created with the Visual Studio portal project template use many of the NuGet packages listed here.  To get started you will need a Package Source

<a name="nuget-packages-for-extension-dependencies-package-sources"></a>
## Package Sources

NuGet uses a package source to retrieve NuGet Packages.  The portal NuGet packages are not currently distributed on public nuget.org and as such have been made available from the following sources

- C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\Packages

	Until the sdk is made publicly available this is the prefered package source for external partners. The Portal.msi installs the NuGet packages to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\Packages and sets up a package source named PortalSDK that can immediately be consumed from Visual Studio.

- [https://msblox.pkgs.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_packaging/IbizaPortal/nuget/v3/index.json](https://msblox.pkgs.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_packaging/IbizaPortal/nuget/v3/index.json)

	This is the prefered package source for internal partners.  NuGets that are delivered to this feed will match the latest bits deployed to production. Internal teams using onebox will need to ensure [https://msblox.pkgs.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_packaging/IbizaPortal/nuget/v3/index.json) is listed as a package source within enlistmentroot\.config\corext*.config
    
  * Note that this feed requires Nuget v3+.  We recommend using [Nuget 3.3+](http://dist.nuget.org/index.html) with the [VSTS credential provider](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/get-started/nuget/auth#vsts-credential-provider)
  * If you are using nuget v2, then you can use the following Nuget v2 url instead: https://msblox.pkgs.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_packaging/IbizaPortal/nuget/v2.  You may be required to create a [Personal Access Token](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/get-started/nuget/auth#personal-access-tokens) in order to get access.  
  * If you get an error about not being able to find the Microsoft.Azure.Gallery.Common nupkg dependency then please add the [WaNuget official](http://wanuget/Official/nuget) feed.  If you are unable to access to the feed then you will need to use the nupkg bundled in the Portal.msi.
