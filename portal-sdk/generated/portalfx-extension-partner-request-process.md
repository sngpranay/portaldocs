## How to file a request?

To file a new request, you can use one of the following work item templates.  They correspond to the tags that we’re using on the internal stackoverflow site where you can ask questions.  This way, if those questions result in requests we can correlate them.

### Important point sto file a request
In order to help us serve you better in acheiving your goals, we need you to fill in some of the important details that help us understand the ask and its criticality better.

The most important fields that help us track the feature asks:
- ``Tags``: when you open a template you do see a default Ibiza tag for the ibiza module the ask is for. Along with that we will require you to fill in your team tag, to identify which team this ask belongs to.
- ``Title``: Once you fill the tag, make sure you fill in title that helps us get high level idea of feature requirement. 
- ``Stack Rank``: You have to provide us the criticality of this ask by stack ranking it in regards to all other requests that you have made. The Stack rank basically helps us undertsand the criticality of the ask and help us plan better.
    - ``100`` is the default value and will be considered as the lowest priority ask for you.
    - You need to stack rank all your requests starting from ``0``- highest priority to ``n`` (n= 1,2,....) based on number of requests you have ordered by priority.
    - If you have nay request that is not required by you but you think will be helpful to make framework better set it to ``200``
- ``Description``- Answer all the question set in the template and fill in the exact description that describes what the ask is actually. Also, it is really helpful to add up your scenario details that tell us why you need it. 
- ``Attachments``  (optional) - It would really help if you also add screen shots or videos that describe your scenario.

## How we will triage your request?

1.	For more urgent requests, again, you are free to engage with PMs on our team.
1.	We will give higher priority to requests that block a scenario that is required to get one of your benchmark usability tasks.  
1.	Please add tag **benchmark-blocker** to your requests if they fall into this category.  We will follow up with our research team to make sure the task is tracked.
1.	Items will be marked as Triage = **Approved** once we’ve read through the item and feel it has sufficient data for the item to be acted upon.
1.	If an item needs more data or is rejected then we will email you during the triage.
1.	Items will be marked as Work Status = **In Progress** once we’ve started working on it.
